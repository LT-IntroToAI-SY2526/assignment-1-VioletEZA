# Assignment 1 - Write UP

## Description
This is the portion of the assignment that will be graded.  I will be looking at your other files, and specifically either `a1.py` or `a1_practice_problems.py`.  I will be looking to see that you completed the problems or used a generative AI to help you come up with and complete some challenge questions.  This document will help guide you through that process.

## What You Need to Submit
1. **Complete the `a1_practice_problems.py` in class**.  Mr. Berg will push solutions to github
2. **Complete the `a1.py` file** with your AI-generated problems and solutions
3. **Complete the reflection questions** in `a1_writeup.md`
4. **Push your changes to GitHub**

Mr. Berg will look at all your files to determine what you have completed.  If there are any questions for this assignment, Mr. Berg will ask in class after he grades them.


## Reflection Questions

After completing your problems, reflect on:

1. **What was your initial experience with Python?** How did it compare to other programming languages you've used?

My initial experience with python wasn't too bad. I do feel like java clicked easier for me but I do feel that with time I will be able to show improvement!

2. **How did you use AI effectively?** Give specific examples of good prompts you used and what you learned from the responses.

My initial prompt was "I'm learning Python basics as a Junior in highschool and Im taking an intro to ai class. I have some experience with java and html. Can you create 5 practice problems that cover:
 Variables and basic data types, Conditionals (if/elif/else), Loops (for and while), Functions, and Basic list operations 
 Make them progressively slightly more challenging. Make sure each problem has clear instructions and example inputs/outputs." but besides that I would ask what's wrong with my code and also asked "Write a function called double_numbers(numbers) that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list where each number is doubled. in python dont asnwer but give guidence" and that was very helpful.

3. **What concepts were most challenging?** How did AI help you understand them?

I feel like functions were the hardest thing for me to understand because I wasn't used to the structure. I would ask Copilot for guidence in how to create functions or what different methods they used within meant. 

4. **What did you learn about collaborating with AI?** What strategies worked best for learning rather than just getting answers?
I learned that AI was honestly very helpful when I asked for guidence because it did it step-by-step and provided multiple ways to do it instead of being only given one way. Also if my code wasn't working and I asked for some help, it gave me tips rather than just doing it for me.
